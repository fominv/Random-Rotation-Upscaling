# Random Rotation Upscaling Study
This repository contains files necessary to perform the presented simulation study on Random Rotation Upscaling in my master thesis.

### How to use this repository?

Download all files and run simulation_study.R. To obtain the same data set as presented in the thesis run construct_data_set.R afterwards.

### How to run a quick test to check if the code really works?

Uncomment lines 15-17 in simulation_study.R.
