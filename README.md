# Random Rotation Upscaling
This repository contains files necessary to perform the presented simulation study on Random Rotation Upscaling in my master thesis.

### How to use this repository?

Just run simulation_study.R. Additionally, to obtain the same data set as presented in the thesis run construct_data_set.R afterwards. Optionally, the final simulation output obtained from the high performance computing cluster Leonhard is provided in the file data_full_simulation.Rdata.

### How to run a quick test to check if the code really works?

Uncomment lines 15-17 in simulation_study.R. The quick test takes around 10 minutes to complete.
